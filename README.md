# Flipkart-Customer-Service-Satisfaction-Machine-Learning-GenAI-with-Microsoft-Azure
📊 Customer Support Satisfaction Prediction
Machine Learning & Generative AI with Microsoft Azure
📌 Project Overview

This capstone project focuses on predicting Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores from customer support interaction data. The goal is to help organizations proactively identify dissatisfied customers, improve support quality, and optimize customer experience using Machine Learning, NLP, and Generative AI concepts, aligned with Microsoft Azure ML practices.

The project covers the complete ML lifecycle — from data understanding and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and business interpretation.

🧠 Problem Statement

Customer support teams handle large volumes of customer interactions daily. Manually identifying dissatisfaction patterns is inefficient and reactive.

Objective:

Predict customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores based on support interaction data to enable early intervention, reduce churn, and enhance service quality.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer support interaction records, including:

Customer messages

Support-related attributes

Interaction metadata

CSAT score (target variable)

The project involves:

Handling missing values

Duplicate removal

Feature engineering

Text preprocessing (for NLP-based features)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Machine Learning Models

Generative AI Concepts

Microsoft Azure ML (Conceptual Alignment)
